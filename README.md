# Popular-Movies
Student project 01 from udacity android developer program.
Via the moviesdb api, this app shows a list of movies posters, the user can sort the list by popularity and users rating or can select a local favorites list.
When a poster is tapped a detail screen is shown, where the user can add that movie to a favorites list.
The detail screen contains additional information such as:
* original title;
* movie poster image thumbnail;
* A plot synopsis;
* user rating;
* release date;
* A list of trailers links (calls youtube when tapped);
* A list of reviews.
